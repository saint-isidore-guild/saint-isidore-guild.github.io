      Although St. Isidore of Seville lived in the 7th century, his enormous work the Etymologiae was a compilation of all known things from his time. He reminds us that the pursuit of knowledge must ultimately be for the greater glory of God. Our guild seeks to understand how we can create technology and share knowledge in our day and age that contributes to human flourishing and leading others to know, love, and serve God.
